# Movie Collection

A movie collection app in order to develop skills using React web development.

Based around Create, Read, Update, Delete features, it is essentially a web app that hosts the ability to host an editable collection of movies.
The project is set to progress from a front end into a full MongoDB, Express, React, Node stack project (MERN)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
